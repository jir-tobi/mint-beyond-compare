That approach has the advantage of simplifying installation for multiple licensed users. Unfortunately, it doesn't always work.  And supporting a combinatoric beastiary of Linux OS and shell choices seems like a lot to ask of a presumably small company. Fortunately, Scooter made Beyond Compare scriptable. This per-user hack gets the job done.\r\n\r\nYes, this repo probably should have been called nemo-beyond-compare. But go load Mint anyway. You'll be glad you did.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\n 1. Clone the repo into ~/.local/share/nemo/actions\r\n\r\n 2. chmod +x helper.py\r\n\r\n 3. ./helper.py   # one-time setup\r\n\r\n 4. Enjoy\r\n\r\nTested With...\r\n--------------\r\n Beyond Compare 3\r\n\r\n Python 2.7\r\n\r\n Nemo 1.8.3\r\n\r\n Linux Mint 15 (Cinnamon on Olivia)\r\n\r\nLegal\r\n---------------------\r\n Copyright (c) 2013 Kyle Ferrio\r\n \r\n Released under the MIT license\r\n","google":"UA-17284184-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
